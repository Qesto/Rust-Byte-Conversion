# Rust-Byte-Conversion
Built all in Rust
Note: For the Binary option, spaces are not allowed and will cause the program to produce the wrong value - fix in progress

All the workings of the conversion process can be found in the source file named "main.rs" and "byte_conversion_rust.exe" is the executable file
